# hello-world
Repository for use with my ServiceNow developer's course. 

I am a 45 year old techie who loves Chess, Game of Thrones and video games.
I used to be a Chef, but now I spend most of my time trying to think of ways 
to become independently wealthy enough so that I can hire someone else to 
cook for me.
